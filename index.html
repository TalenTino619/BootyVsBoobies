    <h1>Boobies Vs. Booty</h1>
    <p>
        All men are born equal, but not all men are born the same. Every man has a favorite sportsteam, favorite rapper,
        favorite pissing technique(balls in or balls out, through the zipper or up the belt). And every on of his
        choices or
        preferences in life tells alot about what kind of "man" he truly is.</p>
    <p>
        Women: Gods' favorite creatures. Lacking in the <b>y chromosome</b> and make it up with some of the craziest
        bodily features like the infamous <em>red moon</em> or the fact that they have a human microwave machine built
        in their tummy tums. That's massive compensation right there and they're not even done. The two most important
        aspects take the front and the back seat. They are, respectively, the boobies and the booty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we get into which men like which part, let's discuss what those parts are and what they exactly mean.</p>
    <h3>The Treasure Chest</h3>

    <p>Man's initial connection to a woman once he's part of the world is through the boobies. First contact with
        humanity is made when he suckles on them titties and they produce substance that'll give him strength and power
        to shut his crying ass off. Their first job is to be the ultimate pacifier and when we honeslty look at the
        world, we see how wars are fought between men and its women(and their treasure chest) that seek to end it
        weather it be by using their sexuality or not.
    <p>

    <h3>Gluteus Maximus (aka The GYATT)</h3>

    <P>
        Now, there's no denying the beautiful symmetry of the <em>fundamental buns</em>. They're bouncy, juicy and fun
        to look at. However, the boobies are bouncier, jucier and much more fun to look at.
    </P>
    <p>Not alot of pros can be found inside the <em>fundamental buns</em> honestly speaking. They're just...there.
        No matter how great they are, they will always (quite literally) follow behind the treasure chest leading the
        march in front.

    <h2>Who Likes What?</h2>
    Let's get the age old stereotypes out of the way first before we reach a verdict.
    <ul>
        <li>Men who like boobies got mommy issues</li>
        <li>Men who like booty are sus and closeted homos</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now why does the first point sound so ridiculous? Clearly its projecting something off of their own thoughts
        because assosicating something so sexual as boobies with their own mothers is pretty damn freudian level sus.
        Seems like THEY'RE the ones with their mommies on their mind all the time. Titties stop being motherly the
        moment one hits puberty and them's just facts. And I officially debunk this stereotype, <em><b>cap!</b></em>
    </p>
    <p>The second point might be onto something. Booty sex is Homosex. Thems just facts. Liking booty means liking
        vuluptuous juicy ones and those can also be found on mens behind. Boobies are exclusively for the ladies but
        both niggas and bitches have that GYATT. So therefore I dub this stereotype, <em><b>valid!</b></em>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    The Verdit is in. Boobies for the W. Booty is still a win but a lowercase w. If you have a homie that likes the
    booty more than the boobies, keep your eyes on 'em. Might switch sides and end up chasing YOU.
